# Algoritmi-fundamentali-C-
The application I designed in C# is a menu, which has the most popular algorithms implemented.
The interface has 4 columns, which contain buttons for fundamental algorithms, vector algorithms, programming techniques and the exit button.
 
The "Algoritmi fundamentali" button incorporates the following implementations and their execution:
- "Nr. prim" - checks whether the introduced number is prime
- "Cmmdc" - displays the greatest common factor of the two inserted numbers
- "Cmmmc" - displays the least common multiple of the two inserted numbers
- "Minim si maxim" - displays the maximum and the minimum of two numbers
- "Interschimbare" - interchanges the values of two numbers
- "Descompunerea unui numar in cifre" - writes all the digits of an inserted number
- "Oglindit" - displays the reversed / reflected inserted number (ex: for a=123 displays 321)
- "Determinarea divizorilor unui numar" - displays all factors of an inserted number
- "Descompunerea in factori primi" - displays all prime factors of an inserted number
- "Conversia din baza 10 in baza 2" - displays the conversion of a decimal number to a binary number
- "Ecuatia de gradul 1" - displays the result of a first degree equation
- "Ecuatia de gradul 2" - displays the result of a second degree equation
- "Factorii si exponentii unui numar" - displays all factors and exponents of a given number
- "Simplificarea unei fractii" - simplifies a fraction, given the numerator and the denominator
- "Insumarea a doua fractii" - calculates the sum of two fractions, given the two numerators and the two denominators

The "Vectori" button incorporates the following implementations and their execution:
- "Sortare" - sorts a given vector
- "Bubble sort" - sorts the given vector, using "Bubble sort"
- "Intersectia a doua multimi" - displays the intersection of two given vectors
- "Reuniune" - displays the union of two given vectors
- "Interclasare" - displays the sorted union of two already sorted vectors
- "Scaderea a doua multimi" - displays the difference between two vectors
- "Inserari in vectori" - inserts number x in a given vector of dimension n, at position p
- "Stergeri in vectori" - deletes the number at the position p from vector v, of dimension n
- "Simularea operatiilor pe multimi in vectori" - checks whether the given vector has duplicate numbers; if duplicates can be found, the program outputs "Nu", otherwise displays "Da"
- "Permutare spre stanga / dreapta" - if "stanga" button is clicked, the program displays all rotations of vector v to the left
                                    - if "dreapta" button is clicked, the program displays all rotations of vector v to the right

The "Tehnici de programare" button incorporates the following implementations and their execution:
- "Recursivitate" - calculates the factorial of a given number n
- "DEI" - calculates the sum of all elements of vector v, using Divide et Impera implementation
- "Backtracking" - displays all permutations of numbers (1, 2, ..., n) for a given number n
- "Programare dinamica" - displays all pairs of numbers from the string of numbers, whose greatest common factor is 1, using dynamic programming

The "Iesire" button closes the menu.
